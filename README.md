# 🌾 Crop Recommendation Using IBM Watsonx AutoAI

This project uses **IBM Watsonx.ai AutoAI** to recommend crops based on soil and environmental data using a machine learning pipeline.

## 📊 Dataset
- `Crop_recommendation.csv`: Contains features like Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.

## ⚙️ Model
- Tool Used: **IBM Watsonx.ai (AutoAI)**
- Fastest & Best Performing Model: **Random Forest Classifier**
- Accuracy: *[Add if known]*

## 🧠 Notes
- The model was trained and evaluated using AutoAI.
- The fastest pipeline selected was based on runtime and accuracy.
- Screenshots included to demonstrate the pipeline selection and performance metrics.

## 🚀 Future Work
- Export model pipeline
- Deploy as an API
- Create an interactive crop recommendation tool
